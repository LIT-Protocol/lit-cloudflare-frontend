# DEPRECATED
This example is on the Lit JS SDK V1. As of October 4, 2023 - the Lit development team is not maintaining Lit JS SDK V1 and will soon deprecate Lit JS SDK V2. The latest SDK version is JS SDK V3 and the latest network to use is the testnet `cayenne`. 

The network this example uses (`jalapeno`) will be supported in the near term, and may be shut down.
